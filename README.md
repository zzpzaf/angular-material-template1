## Angular Template1
# Just with Matelial support.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Development server

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g c <component-name> --module=app.module` to generate a new component. This generates a non-standalone component (the component is added in the app.module).

You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.


Run `ng serve --host 192.168.xx.xx --port 42xx` for a dev server. Navigate to `192.168.xx.xx:42xx/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
